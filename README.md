# Dn-Wiki

Dn-FamiTracker documentation and wiki reference, for programmers and developers working with the format.

## About

There has been a gross lack of documentation of all file formats related to FamiTracker, including 0CC-FamiTracker and its forks. This wiki aims to document as much as possible on file formats relating to module files, instrument files, NSF files, and more.

This wiki also aims to eventually map out and document the entire program's entire inner workings.
